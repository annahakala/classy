1) Insert below the student numbers and names of the 1-3 group members, one per line

Anna Hakala - 595858
Peter Leander - 291767

2) Write below the name of your group

Team Classy

3) Write below a short description of the machine learning problem you plan to address

We want to generate classical music with an RNN. The basic idea is that music can be generated in similar way that language can be with RNNs.

As a basis we will use a model created by Christine McLeavey. We will then create variations of her model and create a small website where we ask people to rate the samples created by the original model and the variations. We will thus get data on which model works the best.

4) Write below what deep learning approach(es) you plan to employ in your project
The base network will be an RNN using LSTM but we will try different variations to see what works best and what doesn't work at all.

5) Write below what deep learning software you plan to use in your project
We will use PyTorch and FastAI.

6) Write below what computational resources you plan to utilize in your project
We will use Google Colab for the computations.

7) Write below what kind of data you plan to use in your experiments
We will use classical music translated to text from midi-files. The translation can be done with MIT's music21 library and midi-files can be downloaded in bulk from Classical archives (https://www.classicalarchives.com).

8) Write below what are the reference methods and results you plan to compare against
As a reference we will use the Clara RNN created by Christine McLeavey (http://christinemcleavey.com/clara-a-neural-net-music-generator/)
